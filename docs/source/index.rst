MagTrack documentation
======================

MagTrack is a Python package for tracking symmetric beads in single-molecule magnetic tweezers experiments. It combines
fast lateral and axial localization with optional GPU acceleration, delivering sub-pixel XYZ coordinates from
experimental recordings. The project ships with a comprehensive example notebook, automated tests, and benchmarking
utilities to help you validate results on your own data.
